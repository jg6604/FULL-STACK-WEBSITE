    <h3>"Gender equality is more than a goal itself. It is a precondition for meeting the chanllenge of reducing poverty, promoting sustainable development and building good governance."</h3>
    <p> A promising solution to build prosperity and equalize the balance of power across gender relationships rests on greater economic independence for women. Investing in women yields profound returns not only for the women involved, but also for their families and for society-at-large.
